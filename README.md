# Python



I used python3 along with some open-source python packages to build a translation program of my own. It is based on Google translate API

The maximum character limit on a single text is 15k. Due to the limitations of the web version of google translate, IT does not guarantee that the Translator would work properly at all times (so please use this Translator if you don’t care about stability). 

Important: If you want to use a stable program, I highly recommend you to use Google’s official translate API.
